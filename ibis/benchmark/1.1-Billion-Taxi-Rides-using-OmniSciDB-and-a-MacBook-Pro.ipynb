    "# 1.1 Billion Taxi Rides using OmniSciDB and a MacBook Pro\n",
    "\n",
    "At 2020 July 1st, Mark Litwintschik, posted a very exciting [blog](https://tech.marksblogg.com/omnisci-macos-macbookpro-mbp.html) about using OmniSciDB on a MacBook Pro for handling 1.1 billion taxi rides! Motivated by this blog post, we were wondering: how it would looks like if it was using [Ibis-framework](ibis-project.org)?\n",

    "So lets start and check the Mark Litwintschik's blog post."

    "The dataset used is a 56 GZIP-compressed CSV files that are 104 GB when compressed and need 500 GB of space when decompressed. For more information check [The Billion Taxi Rides in Redshift](https://tech.marksblogg.com/billion-nyc-taxi-rides-redshift.html) blog post.\n",

    "## Ibis Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "Ibis Framework is a library that implements a similar API provided by pandas for handling database data using expressions. Handling expression instead of handling data directly is very powerful because it allows compound complex expression using just a lit bit of the memory and, when the expression is ready, Ibis compiles that expression (Ibis expression) into a Backend expression, a `SQL` statement for example."
