/*
Creating and maintaining a js-based GraphQL schema can be tedious
especially while developing blindly without a plan, not knowing
what the app will look like, what the naming conventions will be.
So we use semantic-graphql to ease the pain by creating universal
(non-performent) resolving functions and maintaining a RDF schema.
Modifying the RDF schema modifies our GraphQL schema without the
need for writing new resolvers and whatnot.
